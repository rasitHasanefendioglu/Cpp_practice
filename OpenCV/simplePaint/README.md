In order to use this project compile and run the files. Easiest way is using an IDE but command line can be used with a little change in the code.
User should give the size of the canvas i.e. window after this, mouse events will color the white (it can be change by giving argument to function which create window) canvas. 
There are three coloring option and one deleting option.  Deleting option is simply recoloring the 5-pixel radius canvas area by first color color by clicking right mouse button
(and if user keeps pushing it will keep deleting with an unknown sample rate). 
The first coloring option is pixel coloring which can be done by simply moving the mouse cursor, it changes color of the current pixel by a random color which varies between (0-255) in all RGB channels. 
The second option is creating a filled circle with radius 2-pixel by clicking (and if user keeps pushing it will keep coloring with an unknown sample rate) left mouse button 
and lastly user can create big filled circle by middle mouse button with 30-pixel radius.
Parameters can be change by hard coding more features will be add in the future.
